Crack the eggs into a small ramekin or dish. Briefly whisk the water to create a vortex before gently pouring the cracked eggs into the centre of the slowly spinning water. Poach for four minutes in gently simmering water, or until cooked to your liking. Remove from the pan and drain thoroughly on kitchen paper.",
      "To serve, put the bread pieces, roasted tomatoes, three-quarters of the chopped bacon and all of the spinach and basil into a large bowl. Spoon over 1-2 tablespoons of the dressing and toss to combine. Place onto serving plates and top with a poached egg. Season with pepper and sprinkle over the remaining bacon bits.
